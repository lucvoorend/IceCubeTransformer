# Neutrino reconstruction in IceCube detector using GNNs
This github page gives an overview of all the code used for my master thesis, which focusses on reconstructing neutrino events in the IceCube Neutrino observatory located on the south pole. By using the graph neural networks (GNNs) from the GraphNet python framework, various models were trained to [add purpose] . The main purpose of this GitHub page is to act as a resource for myself and future master students on the models that have been trained.

This github page gives an overview of all training scripts, analysis scripts and plots. Due to storage limitations, the selection csv files with or results are not added to this github page. However, they can be found in my personal work folder on the cluster. All scripts and plots on this GitHub are divided into model directories. Each model directory also contains a ReadMe file, which describes the exact database that has been used, the event selection for test, train and validation, the most important model parameters and hyperparameters, and a very short discription of the performance of the model.
